## Codex Compatibility

This is a Codex-native game production workflow.

- Ask the user directly in plain text when a decision or approval is needed.
- Work locally by default instead of assuming custom subagents exist.
- Use Codex `worker` or `explorer` agents only when the user explicitly asks for delegation or parallel work.
- Keep the studio conventions in `docs/CODEX-STUDIO.md`, `docs/studio/technical-preferences.md`, and the plugin references under `plugins/codex-game-studio/references/` in mind while executing this workflow.

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the docs/CODEX-STUDIO.md** for project overview and standards.

2. **Read the relevant agent definition** from `plugins/codex-game-studio/references/roles/` if a specific
   role is specified.

3. **Scan the codebase** for the relevant area:
   - For programmers: scan `src/` for architecture, patterns, key files
   - For designers: scan `design/` for existing design documents
   - For narrative: scan `design/narrative/` for world-building and story docs
   - For QA: scan `tests/` for existing test coverage
   - For production: scan `production/` for current sprint and milestone

4. **Read recent changes** (git log if available) to understand current momentum.

5. **Generate the onboarding document**:

```markdown
